Using the Darklake brand style:
- Headers should use Bitsumishi in neon green.
- For body text, default to Helvetica in light gray or cyan.
- Use the Globe+Water-drop logo (horizontal version) for primary header images.
- Agent Waddles may appear in spot illustrations, especially in contexts implying investigation or stealth.
- Backgrounds may feature a faint retro grid pattern.
- UI icons should use pixel-style Glyphs (e.g. envelope, warning).
- Never distort or recolor the logo outside the allowed palette.
